        <p>The Harvesting the Growth (HTG) initiative has evolved from Scottish Enterprise’s Rural Leadership programme and is targeted at individuals with the focus and ambition to deliver a significant increase in the performance of their business.</p>

<p>Julia Latto, Project Manager in the Rural Operations team, explains how GlobalScots are helping to inspire rural businesses to go for growth.</p>

<p>There’s no substitute for business know-how and experience whichever industry sector you operate in.</p>

<p>That’s the clear message which Julia Latto has taken away from her involvement with the GlobalScot network in her role as Project Manager in Scottish Enterprise’s Rural Operations team.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, Julia has worked closely with a variety of GlobalScots as they have engaged with and advised a wide variety of ambitious businesses in rural communities.</p>

<p>She commented: “I’d have no hesitation in saying that the GlobalScot network is a real gem when it comes to helping develop our companies.</p>

<p>“My dealings with GlobalScots have really opened my eyes to how powerful the network can be. I’ve been involved in a number of events and it’s really inspiring to see how the breadth of experience and life knowledge which these individuals bring to the table can have such an impact on companies.</p>

<p>“The GlobalScots we’ve worked with quite often come from other sectors but the leadership and management skills they’ve acquired in building their careers can be applied to any business with ambition.</p>

<p>Julia’s experience with GlobalScots encompasses roundtable events involving business leaders such as David Farqhuar, who made his name in the technology sector, Gordon Cunninghame, a former head of procurement at retail giant Gap Inc and Graham Watson, a corporate finance expert and GlobalScot founding member.</p>

<p>A Rural Gathering event last year also brought together alumni from the Rural Leadership programme and included workshops hosted by GlobalScots Gary Steele and David Wilkinson.</p>

<p>Julia continued: “Our main focus is on development of leadership skills and the input we’ve had from GlobalScots in that regard has been invaluable.”</p>

<p>A typical example was the experience of John Sinclair, who with his wife Kirsteen, runs Craigie’s Farm Deli and Café at West Craigie Farm, South Queensferry, near Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Originally a dairy farm managed by his father, John has gradually expanded the business, opening a new shop, café and butchery and now employing more than 40 people.</p>

<p>John was one of a number of business leaders who attended an HTG Learning Journey event in London last year.</p> 

<p>He confirms that he has continued to reap the benefits of engaging with the GlobalScot network and, in particular, with GlobalScot John Stewart who will step down this year as chairman of Legal &and; General.</p>

<p>John Sinclair said: “As the business has grown over the years, the main issue for me has been around staffing.</p>

<p>“It’s probably fair to say that many businesses in the farming sector employ people because of who they are rather than the skills they have.</p>

<p>“The discussions I had with John really made me look at recruitment and our skills gap in an entirely different way. He encouraged me to look much more closely at our people and really analyse what they were bringing to the business and if they really had the skills we needed.</p>

<p>“Just taking the time to assess who our best performers were, how to harness their enthusiasm and how to develop staff who we knew could do better was really valuable.</p>

<p>“He also suggested that with things like probation periods for new staff – which we did operate – that we really use those to properly assess what progress people were making.”</p>

<p>John confirms that the input he received from John Stewart continues to benefit the company.</p>

<p>“We now have a much happier working environment and our people are really adding value to the business. We’ve been able to improve the performance of a number of employees and, in general, any issues with staffing have become much less significant.</p>

<p>“We’ve recently doubled the size of our premises and both turnover and profitability are up.</p>

<p>“I’d definitely recommend using the GlobalScot network to other companies in the rural sector – there’s no doubt that the input we received from John really has helped change the business.”</p>

<p>And Julia agrees that there are real benefits for rural companies in engaging with the network.</p>

<p>“The companies we’ve worked with have definitely been inspired by their engagement with these senior business leaders and the insight they’re able to offer.”</p>
