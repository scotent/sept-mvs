A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. The only personal information a cookie can obtain is information a user supplies him or herself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies, however, enhance our web site performance in a number of ways, including providing a secure way for us to verify your identity during your visit to our web site and personalising your experience on our site, making it more convenient for you. The Scottish Enterprise web site uses cookies so that we can serve you better. You can refuse cookies by turning them off on your web browser and you do not need to have cookies turned on to successfully use our service.

    <h3>Use of Web Beacons</h3>
    <p>Scottish Enterprise Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called - single-pixel gifs - which allows Scottish Enterprise to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.

We use this data to better understand web site usage so we know what areas of our web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting, but is not attributed to you as an individual.</p>
    
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We recognise industry standards and employ security safeguards to protect information from unauthorised access and misuse. We use the most accurate and current information you provide in order to process your request. Furthermore, whenever you transmit sensitive information such as billing or credit card information to us through our web site we provide you access to our secure server that allows encryption across the internet.</p>
