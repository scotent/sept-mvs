        <p>As the founders of Edinburgh’s first exclusive gin distillery in over 150 years, business partners Matt Gammell and Marcus Pickering are already demonstrating they have the recipe for success.</p>

<p>Hand crafted at Summerhall Distillery, Pickering’s Gin has already won a slice of an increasingly crowded marketplace, partly due to support from GlobalScot. The growth in the popularity of gin in recent years has been huge with as many as 1400 different gins now available across the world.</p>

<p>Matt Gammell, co-founder and director of Edinburgh-based Pickering’s Gin, which has only been on the market for two years, admits that initially he thought his firm were a little late in joining the party.</p>

<p>He said: “With so many new gins coming to market, I genuinely thought we had some catching up to do. In hindsight, we can actually see now that we were at the start of the curve.”</p>

<p>The strategy which Matt and business partner Marcus Pickering adopted was to target key overseas markets, specifically Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p>“We’d decided that both territories were ideal for the products we were creating. Part of the reason was that we already had some good contacts in both countries. But, added to that, we were aware that plans were already in place for the touring Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo to visit both countries.”</p>

<p>The arrival of one of Scottish tourism’s most high profile events provided the perfect opportunity for the firm to launch their products, as Pickering’s were exceptionally fortunate to have become the official gin of the Tattoo in June 2014.</p>

<p>The tie-up for Australia had its origins in a meeting arranged by Nancy Raich of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, with GlobalScot Ramsey Macpherson, operations director with DMN Australia.</p>

<p>Matt continued: “I’d been aware of GlobalScot for some time but it became really relevant for us once we’d identified which markets we wanted to target.</p>

<p>“We were introduced to Ramsey in August 2015, began putting the wheels in motion and then agreed to meet again in Australia in November.</p> 

<p>“He really was fantastic for us, particularly his involvement in securing our deal with the Tattoo in Australia which also allowed us to showcase our products to guests when it came to Melbourne in early 2016.”</p> 

<p>“He also put us in touch with the company in Australia who are now our distributors. They run a franchise called Whisky Live and import and distribute a number of spirits.</p>

<p>“We were able to meet them face-to-face and agree a deal and also get comfort that our product wouldn’t end up in discount retailers or low budget supermarkets.” Success in Australia was followed up by a similar story in New Zealand.</p>

<p>“Through Ramsey, we were put in touch with SDI’s Iain Steele who reached out to his network of contacts in New Zealand. That led us to GlobalScot Iain Fraser who arranged contact with Regional Wines &and; Spirits in Wellington and, within an hour of meeting with them, we had agreed a distribution deal.</p>

<p>“Thanks to the GlobalScot network, we’ve achieved great distributors in both our target countries. And while it’s still early days we have a fantastic relationship with both. After only a few months our Australian distributors have arranged significant listings with one of the main chains of independent wine shops in Sydney.</p>

<p>“And, in New Zealand, we’ve had great uptake from good independent retailers throughout the country.</p>

<p>“Things are going in the right direction. The next stage of our campaign is to target the US. We’re fully aware that’s a daunting task which we know will take longer to crack but we’ll look to replicate the approach we took with GlobalScot in Australia and New Zealand.”</p>

<p>Matt confirms that the connections which GlobalScot has in their key markets have been invaluable.</p>

<p>“Ramsey and Iain’s access to contacts, to the right people, really made a difference. It’s fantastic to have that level of support.”</p>
