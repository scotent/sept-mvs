        If the costs you are claiming appear as part of a single bulk Bacs payment on your bank statement (for example, as 'Payroll'), then you must submit a
        <strong>Bacs transaction list,</strong>as well as a bank statement as evidence of payment. Any transactions not relevant to your claim can be redacted (obscured or scored through).</p>
    <p>The Bacs transaction list must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be clearly identifiable as coming from your payment or payroll system</li>
        <li>Clearly show <strong>individual payees, payment amounts</strong> and <strong>dates</strong></li>
    </ul>
