            <p>To complete your claim, you'll need to upload the following evidence:</p>
            <p><strong>Payslips</strong> covering the whole period you're claiming for. For example, if this is a quarterly claim, you should upload three month's payslips.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Bacs statement(s)</strong> covering the whole period you're claiming for. The Bacs statement(s) should show the individual salary payments. If you don't use Bacs, then include output from your payroll system that lists individual salary payments. If you pay individual salaries directly from your bank account, then you don't need to upload any other payroll statement.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Bank statement(s)</strong> showing either the total Bacs or payroll amounts for the period you are claiming for; or showing the individual salary payments for the period you are claiming for.
