<p>Any business looking to set up and trade in a new geography are faced with many challenges such as the legalities of setting up a business, having the correct contacts and an understanding a region’s business environment.</p>

<p>Euan Lockhart, CEO of OES Oilfield Services Group is a GlobalScot, a worldwide network of over 600 entrepreneurial and inspirational business leaders assisting Scottish companies to succeed in new international marketplaces.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2001, Scottish Enterprise’s GlobalScot service has provided unique access to a group of experts providing support and making connections across all key business sectors.</p>
