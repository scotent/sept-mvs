        <h2 class="emphasis">2. Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies)</h2>

        <p>SE uses the Adobe Flash Player to deliver its video content services throughout the site. To improve user experience, Local Shared Objects - or Flash Cookies as they are commonly known - are employed to provide features such as auto-resume and for saving your preferences. Flash Cookies are stored on a user's terminal much the same as cookies are, however it is not possible to manage them at browser level in the same way.</p>

        <p class="text-bold">How to disable Flash Cookies:</p>
        
        <p>The Adobe website provides comprehensive information on how to delete or disable Flash cookies either for a specific domain like Scottish-enterprise.com or for all websites.</p>

        <h2 class="emphasis">3. Cookies set by third party sites</h2>

        <p>We sometimes embed photos and video content from websites such as YouTube and Flickr. As a result, when you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. SE does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.</p>
        
        <p>Most browsers will give you the option to accept cookies from websites while blocking those from third parties. Check your browser's Help for details, or visit the <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">About cookies<span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span></a> website for more information.</p>

        <h2 class="emphasis">4. Sharing tools</h2>

        <p>We would like to draw your attention to the fact that the SE website now carries embedded ‘share’ buttons to enable users of the site to easily share articles with their friends through a number of popular social networks. These sites may set a cookie when you are also logged in to their service. SE does not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check the relevant third party website for more information about these.</p>
        
        <p>Again, most browsers will give you the option to block these cookies if you wish, although it may prevent you from being able to use these services if you do.</p>
