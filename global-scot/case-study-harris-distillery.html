title: Harris Distillery - dreaming a little dram
---

<p class="text-bold">GlobalScots gathered to regenerate the Harris economy, and enjoy a wee dram from the Isle of Harris Distillery.</p>

<p>Anderson Bakewell’s love of the small Scottish island of Harris inspired his decision to explore the world of the wee dram.</p>

<p>The unusual project has now captured the imaginations of GlobalScots around the world, the support of whom has made the venture not only a possibility but a potentially game-changing reality.</p>

<p>“Anderson has been connected with the island of Harris for 45 years,” explains Simon Erlanger, the former Sales and Marketing Director for Glenmorangie and future Managing Director of Anderson’s brainchild – The Isle of Harris Distillery.</p>

<p>“In the past 50 years the population of Harris has halved as young people migrate to the mainland and beyond in search of employment, so it has an aging population and a very fragile economy.</p>

<p>“Anderson fell in love with it as a young man and was always looking for an initiative to help regenerate the local economy. It had to be something with longevity that was sustainable and what could be more sustainable than a whisky distillery?"</p>

<p>With the idea for The Isle of Harris Distillery in place, Anderson used GlobalScot to find the help he needed to get the project up and running.</p>

<p>This included getting a management team in place – Simon, and former Chief Financial Officer of Whyte and Mackay Ron MacEachran – who between them brought significant experience in the whisky industry.</p>

<p>“When somebody says to you they’re thinking of building a distillery on the Isle of Harris, there’s something that just makes incredible sense,” adds Simon.</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful place and there’s never been a distillery there before. I was also attracted to the social ethos of the project. It is one of the first distilleries to ever be built with the view to help regenerate an economy which is very exciting.”</p>

<p>With GlobalScot support, Anderson and his new team were able to connect with around 50 GlobalScots internationally who seemed to be equally enthusiastic about the initiative.</p>

<p>“Anderson had a meeting with the GlobalScot team and they sent out an email to all their members which got a fantastic response,” says Simon.</p>

<p>“We made connections with a variety of people and those connections led to our single biggest pledge of investment which enabled us to complete the equity element of our funding requirements. Without that, I’m not sure this project would be going ahead.</p>

<p>“The other really positive output from the network has been with a Scottish jewellery designer based in New York. Having met Anderson, she was really keen to find out more and came over to Harris to have a look around the site. She’s now a huge fan of the project and has offered to help us with our branding and perhaps creating a range of items to sell in the distillery shop.”</p>

<p>The team is now poised to begin the building of the distillery in early 2014 and aims to create up to 20 jobs over the next few years.</p>

<p>Besides being committed to a high degree of quality on every level, the company is also keen to make the encounter of the distillery a special one for the visitor.</p>

<p>“We want to ensure that the experience reflects the island’s character of hospitality, warmth and timelessness,” says Simon.</p>

<p>“What has been hugely gratifying has been the support from the public sector in general.</p>

<p>“We received one of the biggest ever grants from the Scottish Government under the Food Processing, Marketing and Cooperation Grant Scheme, and Highlands and Islands Enterprise has provided grant support beyond our expectations. Scottish Enterprise will be an important equity investor via its Venture Fund.</p>

<p>“It has been quite overwhelming to see how the project has really captured peoples’ imaginations - they see the benefits of what we’re trying to do, which is most gratifying.”</p>
