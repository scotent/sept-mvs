<p>Taste of Arran is an ‘umbrella’ company that brings together 11 premium food and drink producers on the Isle of Arran and acts as a single point for sales, marketing and distribution. They wanted to break into exporting but needed good local contacts to introduce them to markets – and they found what they needed through GlobalScot.</p>

<p>They were introduced to GlobalScot Guy Crawford, CEO of the Jumeirah group of hotels in Dubai who hosted a Scottish promotion week in his Jumeirah Beach Hotel, giving Scottish companies the opportunity to showcase their produce. Taste of Arran’s cheese range was one of the products on show and the Jumeirah chefs were impressed.</p>

<p>“The chefs loved our cheeseand asked if we could start supplying them. So without us having people out there, we had got our first customer,” says Alastair.

<p>Buoyed up by this success, Alastair and his team decided to take more of their produce out to Gulfood, a major Middle East food exhibition, in February 2012. “We focused on cheese, oatcakes and ice cream and all three rangesgot great praise,” says Alastair.</p>

<p>“The GlobalScot team put me in touch with 4 GlobalScots out there and I had meetings with all of them. Everyone they introduced me to gave me a colossal amount of time. It’s hard to quantify the value of that – it just makes things so much easier.</p>

<p>“The GlobalScots were keen to help identify any opportunities and steer us towards good partners for distribution. They told us how business and commercial operations work in the area. It brings out one of the best traits of the Scottish psyche in that people like to help each other and to get that local knowledge is just invaluable.</p>

<p>“We met Guy Crawford, John Beveridge from Hyatt, Robert Mitchell who has a distribution business who we’re now working with and George Lindsay, from SAPIN W.L.L. in Bahrain. George brought his whole team round and it gave me a great sense of pride that he wanted to introduce all these people to our products. It was quite levelling to get these guys in and see them excited at what we’ve got.”</p>

<p>Alastair feels that it would have taken Taste of Arran longer to get their products into the Middle East without the help of GlobalScot. “We might not even have tried,” he says. “You’ve just got to get out there and get on with it and that’s maybe what scares a lot of people. It didn’t really scare us to go out there and have a go. But there’s no doubt about it, the process was helped immeasurably by Scottish Development International  and GlobalScot.”</p>
