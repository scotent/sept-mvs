<p>Scottish Development International is committed to making its services accessible to everyone, including those with special needs.</p>

<p>If you use a screen reader, or some other device to help you view the Internet, you might prefer to use the text-only version of this site. It is just as complete and up-to-date as the graphical version.</p>

<p>Every web page on this site should conform to Level-A of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Additionally, we are working towards Level-AA for the more popular sections of the web site. Our ultimate goal is to achieve Level-AAA throughout the entire site.</p>

<p>However, we're not perfect, so if you spot a problem please let us know by emailing us (<a href="mailto:investment@scotent.co.uk" role="">investment@scotent.co.uk</a>) or completing the feedback form. Alternatively, please call Scottish Development International on <a href="tel:08009179534" role="">0800 917 9534</a> form within the UK or <a href="tel:+441412282828" role="">+44 141 228 2828</a> if you are overseas. We'll fix the problem as soon as we can.</p>
